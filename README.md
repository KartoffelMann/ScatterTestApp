#### The basic necessities to run it

## Install [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
###### Once they're downloaded verify installation:
```
python --version
Python 3.7.2

pip --version
pip 19.3.1

virtualenv --version
16.7.5
```
## Get Environment Started
Create virtual environment
```
virtualenv venv
```

Wait for it to complete then start the environment. Afterwards, install required packages
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Set the environment variables so flask knows what to run
```
# For Powershell users
$env:FLASK_APP="FlaskAPP"
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"

# For cmd shell users
set FLASK_APP=FlaskAPP
set FLASK_ENV=developement
```

Create a config file using the config_example.py file located in FlaskAPP and set the values
Then run the flask app!
```
flask run
```
